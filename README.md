## Project overview
This project performs an end-to-end data analytics pipeline focused on the German real estate market. Using a dataset from “immoscout24” of cleaned real estate listings, the project explores property features, market trends, and pricing patterns to support data-driven decision-making for real estate investors, agents, or buyers. The project uses SQL, Python, and Tableau/Power BI for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
