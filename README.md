# Apartment-Rental-Offers-in-Germany  
**Portfolio Final Project â€“ Ironhack**  

---

## **Project Overview**  
This project performs an end-to-end data analytics pipeline focused on the German real estate market. Using a dataset from *immoscout24* of cleaned real estate listings, the project explores property features, market trends, and pricing patterns to support data-driven decision-making for real estate investors, agents, and buyers.  

The analysis leverages **SQL, Python, and Tableau/Power BI** for data processing, statistical analysis, and interactive visualization.  

---

## **Business Case**  
The goal is to analyze the German real estate market by examining key property attributes and their impact on prices. This will help stakeholdersâ€”such as real estate investors, agents, and homebuyersâ€”understand market dynamics and make informed investment or purchasing decisions.
